# Sign in with Apple on ASP.NET Core (MVC & Razor)

In 2019 Apple announced and released 'Sign in with Apple' at their Worldwide Developer Conference (WWDC).  'Sign in with Apple' is the fast, easy way for people to sign in to apps or websites using the Apple IDs they already have.  In doing so Apple joined many other OpenID and OAuth identity providers including Facebook, Google, Microsoft, Amazon and others.  Providing authentication from external identity providers is of great value to your app or website as it simplifies access and increases usage.  With just a click or two, new users are able to sign in and begin using your app or website.  

In this repository I have provided sample projects for implementing 'Sign in with Apple' using both ASP.NET Core MVC and Razor.  

## Features
- Retrieve and display the Id, First Name, Last Name, Full Name and Email Address of the Apple ID user
- Handle the initial Apple ID sign in and all subsequent sign ins as the data response is different with Apple ID
- Redirect the user back to your website using the Redirect Url
